# teacher-pi

Born of necessity, this project makes use of several existing bits of software, including Raspbian Stretch as a headless O.S. and...
 - Apache
 - PHP
 - MySQL
 - Wordpress

Before we can begin customizing the Raspberry Pi for the classroom, we need to setup a LAMP server and install/configure Wordpress.

    sudo apt-get install apache2 php mysql-server php-mysql
